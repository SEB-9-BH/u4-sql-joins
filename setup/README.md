## Optional Setup

All of the exercises in this lesson can be run directly in the terminal. *In fact we would recommend it.*


**If you want to write your queries in a file and run them you can do the following steps.**

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your **`~/code/ga/lectures`** directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called **`sql-joins`**, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir sql-joins
cd sql-joins
```

Open the contents of the directory in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```

Create a SQL file for your queries:

```bash
touch queries.sql
```

Run the queries file in the terminal:

```bash
psql -f queries.sql
```
