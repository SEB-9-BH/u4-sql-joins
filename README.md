## About

This module is designed to teach learners the fundamentals of SQL joins and data modeling. Through practical examples, such as designing an ice cream manufacturing management system, learners will explore how to create and normalize database schemas, understand one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, and leverage SQL joins to construct advanced queries.
